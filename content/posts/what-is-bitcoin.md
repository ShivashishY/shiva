## **What is Bitcoin  and History**

Bitcoin is a decentralized currency, so it is not tied to any
Specific country or currency. It is a currency built on top of the blockchain.
technology, so transactions made with bitcoin are public and
Chronologically stored on the blockchain. This means that anyone can see all the
transactions done so far.

Bitcoin was introduced in 2009 by an individual or group named Satoshi Nakamoto.
Bitcoin was a way to create a digital version of cash where payments
could be made from person to person without having to go through a financial
institution or another middleman, who might charge a fee for this type of
payment and can slow down the processing time.

Anyone can use bitcoin as we all use the internet, and there is no owner of it,
in the same way, bitcoin is also there.

## **Why is bitcoin used?**

We can use bitcoin to make online payment or to do any transactions.
Bitcoin works on peer-to-peer network-based so people can easily
transact with each other directly with no bank, credit card or through any
company.

Bitcoin is considered the fastest and most efficient to use in transactions.
Nowadays, many people are adopting bitcoin-like online developers,
Entrepreneurs, non-profit organizations, etc. And because of this, bitcoin is
being used for global payment all over the world.

Like we do online transactions using other currencies, then we have to follow
the payment process of banks, only then we can make payment and the
account of every transaction by us is present in our bank account so that
it can be detected. Where and how much money has been spent, but there is no.
owner of bitcoin, so the transactions done with it are recorded in a public
ledger (account) which is called bitcoin "blockchain".

There, all the transaction details done with bitcoin are stored, and the same
blockchain is the proof of whether the transaction has taken place.

## **Bitcoin today rate**

The value of Bitcoin is about \$48740.50 in today's day, so the
value of one Bitcoin is 3716609.35. Its value keeps getting more or less because
there is no authority to control it, so its value keeps changing according to
its demand.

## **What is a bitcoin wallet?**

We can only store bitcoin electronically, and a bitcoin wallet is needed to keep
it. There are many types of bitcoin wallets such as desktop wallets, mobile.
wallets, online / web-based wallets, hardware wallets, using one of these
wallets, we have to create an account in it.

This wallet gives us a unique id as an address as if you have
earned bitcoin from somewhere, and you have to store it in your account, then
you need that address there and with the help of that, you can transfer
Bitcoin to your account. Can keep in a wallet.

Apart from that, if you want to buy or sell bitcoin, then you require a bitcoin
wallet and after that, all the money you get for the bitcoin you
sell can also get it transferred to your bank account through bitcoin wallet.

## **How to earn bitcoin**

We can earn bitcoin in three ways. Here we have given complete information on
how to create a bitcoin account.

1.  The first way is that if you have money, then you can buy a bitcoin directly
    by paying \$999. It is also not that if you want to buy a bitcoin, then you.
    have to pay the full \$999. You can also buy the smallest unit.
    of bitcoin ‚ÄúSatoshi‚Äù.

    Just like there are 100 paise in 1 rupee in our India, in the same way,
    there are 100 million Satoshi in 1 bitcoin, so you can
    gradually accumulate 1 or more bitcoin by buying the smallest amount of
    bitcoin Satoshi. When you have bitcoin and its price will increase, then.
    you can earn more money by selling it.

2.  Another way is that if you are selling any goods to someone online and if
    bitcoin is present with that buyer, then you take bitcoin for
    money, in this case, you will sell those goods to them, and you will also
    get bitcoin. Which will be stored in your bitcoin wallet. Later.
    you can also get a profit by selling that bitcoin to another person at a
    higher price.

3.  The third way is bitcoin mining. For this, we will need a computer with a
    High-speed processor whose hardware should also be good. We use bitcoin only.
    for online payment and when someone pays with bitcoin, that transaction is
    verified.

Those who verify them are called miners and those miners have high-performance
Computers and GPU, and verify the transactions through this. They verify
whether the transactions are correct, or whether any kind of manipulation
Has been done in it. In exchange for this verification, they get some bitcoins
as a reward and in this way, new bitcoins come to the market.

Anyone can do this, for this a computer with a high-speed processor is needed,
which is not in everyone's budget to buy.

Just like in every country, there is a limit to print currency in a year that you
can print just so many notes' year, in the same way, there are some limitations
with bitcoin as well that over 21 million bitcoins cannot come into the
Market. The limit of bitcoin is just 21 million, more bitcoin will
never be found than that.

Talking about now, about 13 million bitcoins have arrived in the market and the
new bitcoins will now come through mining.

## **Advantages of bitcoin**

-   Here, your transaction fee is very less than paying by credit card and debit
    card.

-   You can send Bitcoin anywhere and anytime in the world with no hassle.

-   There is no account block of bitcoin here, like sometimes for some reason
    the bank blocks our credit or debit card, then that problem does not happen
    here.

-   If any government or authority in the transaction process of Bitcoin does
    not monitor you, then many people also use it to do wrong things.
    then it is beneficial for them.

## **Disadvantages of bitcoin**

-   There is no authority, bank, or government to control bitcoin here, so due
    to this, there are many fluctuations in the price of bitcoin, then it
    becomes risky.

-   If your account ever gets hacked, then you will lose all your bitcoins and it
    cannot be brought back, no one will help you with this.
