## Introduction 

Everyone is talking about blockchain. It doesn't matter which industry you work for, all of them are trying to implement blockchain. Some of them are still doing POC and some of them are actually implementing it. Everyone wants to get into this technology. Now blockchain is innovative technology. Which is changing a lot of stuff, right? It is replacing the old way of working and then implementing a new way. 

There are two kinds of people. The survivors and the swept await. The survivors catch the wave at the right time and make the most of it, while the swept awaits often late to react, and thus they get washed away.
 The world has witnessed these two for the longest time. To give you an example, go back to the world's greatest film company, **KODAK**. At one time failed to embrace the digital wave, which led to the sad demise. This brings us to the question of which technology should we gear up for? 

Well, apart from **Cloud computing, AI, Data Science and Machine Learning. Blockchain is one technology we cannot afford to miss**. 
>  According to Gartner, the business value of blockchain is going to touch $176 billion by 2025.
