## What are dApps (Decentralized Applications)?

Ever since Blockchain came into existence, it has opened many possibilities for us humans and has changed the way we look at technology. In this comes a famous name, dApp. You must have heard this word in many places and many times you must have thought that you have heard these apps, but what are these dApps?

## What are dApps, and how does it work? 

dApp is an open-source application that means everyone can use it, and we can see and read the coding with which they are made.

dApps run with the help of Blockchain technology and being decentralized, they are not controlled by any one person or group. The same simple apps like OLA, UBER, Paytm, Twitter, Instagram are public, they can be used by anyone, but these apps are controlled by any one group and organization.

## How dApp differs from traditional App?

Traditional apps are made through coding, which cannot be read or seen by a common person and these apps are controlled by an organization that can bring any changes in these traditional apps whenever they want. Anyone can read the coding done in the same dApp and once the coding is written, it cannot be changed.

Hacking these apps is also very easy. You must have heard about the data leak of big apps like Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn many times in the news.

We think that this is such a big company, how their data can be leaked, and we remain sure, but even these big companies cannot protect themselves from hackers.

Apps like Facebook, Instagram, etc. have their own servers where they store all the data in one place, unlike in dApps. The data is not saved in one place but is saved in many computers, which are called Peer.

Because of this, there is no cost to maintain these apps and because of the data being stored in over one computer, it also becomes impossible to hack it.

## Advantages Of dApps


1. Whatever information and data is recorded in the dApp cannot be changed back.

2. It is not controlled by any third party, due to which no one can stop you from using them.

3. Their data is not stored in one place but is stored in many computers, due to which they can never face network-related problems, which are often seen in common apps.

4. They cannot be blocked by the government or any organization because the dApp is not hosted on any IP address.

## Disadvantages Of dApps

1. If anything is missed by mistake while making these apps, then this mistake can be very heavy, and if the hacker catches that mistake then he can easily hacking.

2. Because of the new technology, the number of people using these apps is less, due to which people do not have that much trust in the dApp, they are afraid to use it that there may be no fraud with them.

3. Updating and maintaining them is a hard task, as each peer will have to update their node software.

4. The way KYC is done in a normal app, it is known who is using that app, but no KYC is required in dApp, if someone does fraud with you tomorrow, then you do not know. Will find who has done that fraud.
