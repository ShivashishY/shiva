## Introduction



Web 3.0 means decentralized web, i.e. in this version nothing will be decided on the features of the website, rather its major element will be decentralization. Blockchain technology will power this decentralization, i.e. Web 3.0, and this technology is also used in Cryptocurrency.

In blockchain technology, no data is stored on any one computer or server, but it is a little on all the computers around the world, due to which it will be impossible for the hacker to hack it.

In Web 2.0, the Internet is tied from all sides, but in Web 3.0 it will be completely open and it will be secure, that is, it will be impossible for a hacker to hack any data. 

Since the 2010s, the development of the third version of the web, Web 3.0, has started, and it will be several steps ahead of Web 2.0. This new version will be completely open, and our web security here will be completely secure.

The third version of the web, Web 3.0, has been invented to improve the shortcomings in the last two versions even better, in this version our data on the Internet will be completely safe. Control of the third version of the web i.e. Web 3.0 will not be with only one, but everyone will have a little, that is, in a way you understand that no one will have control of it, so the hackers will be impossible to hack any data.

Now you must be feeling that how everyone can have a little control of Web 3.0, then you must have heard the name of the cryptocurrency, its control is not with anyone, but it is a little on every computer.

And in such a situation, even if a hacker wants to hack, then he cannot hack all the computers or servers around the world simultaneously.

The way the data of Cryptocurrency is written in the blockchain, in the same way, the data in decentralization will not be in any one computer but will remain in the blockchain and in this case, your data will be completely safe and secure.

For example, if you buy a domain name in the version of Web 3.0, then no one will be able to remove the buyer's name, address, and any kind of information because all this information will remain in the Blockchain.

## **Advantages of Web 3.0**

### 1. **Decentralization -:** 
Web 3.0 will be completely decentralized, which means no hosting server website will be able to control your website, and you will run that website on your own.

### 2. **Blockchain Technology -:** 
This system will work on Blockchain technology, due to which the data of the website will be stored on many (block) computers, then it will be almost impossible to hack your website. If hacked, then only the servers of that block will be down, not the entire website.
### 3. **Security -:** 
In Decentralized, we get complete security because when our data is on anyone's lake, it is possible to hack it, but here our data will not be on anyone's lake. In such a situation, hackers cannot hack all the computers in the world simultaneously. Even if the file of your website gets corrupted in one system, then the IPFS system will compare the file with the other system, and we will know that that file is corrupt, we will not use it and in this way, our blog or The website will be secure forever.
### 4. **Privacy-:** 
In Web 3.0 Decentralized, our data will not remain in any one server or computer but will be scattered in all the computers of the world, so no one will find our data and in this way, our privacy will remain safe.
### 5. **Our Data Will Be Semantic -:** 
Web 2.0 Our data depends on words and keywords, but on Web 3.0 all our data will be cemented.
### 6. **Onetime domain registration -:** 
In this system, you will also be able to register a domain. On Web 3.0 you will register NFT domains, NFT domains are those domains that will not have to be renewed every year. Which you can also make a website address or any wallet address.
### 7. **Serverless hosting -:** 
Web 3.0 will work on blockchain technology, then the entire data of the website will be on the blockchain server, you will not have to buy hosting from any hosting company, then it is not a serverless hosting system.

## **Why Web 3.0 is special? What makes Web 3.0 superior?**

### **No central point of control:** 
Since intermediaries are removed from the equation, user data will no longer be controlled by them. This reduces the risk of censorship by governments or corporations and reduces the effectiveness of denial-of-service (DoS) attacks.

### **Increased Information Interconnectivity:** 
As more products connect to the Internet, larger data sets provide algorithms with more information for analysis. This can help them provide more accurate information that accommodates the specific needs of the individual user.

### **More efficient browsing:** 
When using search engines, finding the best results used to be quite challenging. However, over the years, they have gotten better at finding semantically relevant results based on search context and metadata. This results in a more convenient web browsing experience that can help anyone find accurate information with relative ease.

Web 2.0 also introduced social tagging systems, but they can be manipulated. With smart algorithms, the results can be filtered as manipulated by the AI.

### **Better Advertising &amp; Marketing:** 
No one likes to be bombarded with online ads. However, if ads apply to one's interests and needs, they can be useful rather than annoying. Web 3.0 aims to improve advertising by leveraging smart AI systems and targeting specific audiences based on consumer data.

### **Better Customer Support:** 
When it comes to websites and web applications, customer service is key to a smooth user experience. However, because of heavy costs, many web services that become successful cannot scale up their customer service operations accordingly. Through the use of smart chatbots that can talk to multiple customers at once, users can enjoy an enhanced experience while working with support agents. Digital artists are also bringing their works in front of the world by making them NFT by using web 3.0 and blockchain.

## **Upcoming future | Coming future**

Given the history of the Internet, the development of a more meaningfully intelligent Web makes sense. The data were first presented statistically to the users. Then users could interact with that data dynamically. Now, all that data will be used by algorithms to improve the user experience and make the web more personal and familiar.

Web 3.0, while not fully defined, can leverage peer-to-peer (P2P) technologies such as blockchain, open-source software, virtual reality, Internet of Things (IoT).

Currently, many applications are limited to running on only one operating system. Web 3.0 can enable applications to be more device-agnostic, which means they will be able to run on many types of hardware and software without any additional development costs.

Web 3.0 also aims to make the Internet more open and decentralized. In the current framework, users have to rely on network and cellular providers to survey the information that moves through their systems. With the advent of distributed ledger technology, that may soon change, and users can take back ownership of their data.

## **Web 3.0 Examples**

The biggest example of Web 3.0 is dApps (Decentralized Applications)_ like _Uniswap, Pancakeswap, Opensea, Aave, Compound_, that is, applications that are not controlled by a single party, where any website is blocked from the Internet with the help of its IP address. It is impossible to remove or block the same dApps from the Internet because they are not hosted on any IP address, due to which it is almost impossible to block.

DApps do not collect your data from you, to use their service you need a Private Wallet like MetaMask, Trust Wallet which is decentralized.

Bitcoin also comes in Web 3.0 on which no one has any control, there are nodes of bitcoin spread all over the world that verify its transaction with the help of Proof of Work Consensus Mechanism and then store it on the blockchain.

Blockchain Games like Axie Infinity, SandBox, Star Atlas, etc. Games by which you can earn money, till now in Wb2.0 we used to play Online Games only for fun, for which we did not get any money but now in Web 3.0 You can also enjoy the game and earn money as well.
