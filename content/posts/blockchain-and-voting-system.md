## Introduction

It is often seen that at the time of elections, people feel sorry that they are deprived of exercising their franchise because of important work coming, but now it will not happen because in India the Election Commission IIT Madras (IIT-Madras) to develop a new technology in which voters will vote even if they are in any other city or state away from their constituency. 

An Election Commission of India official said that the project is currently in the research and development stage and the aim is to develop a 'prototype'. This future initiative of the Commission is also expected to increase the voting percentage and reduce the cost of conducting elections. The project is currently in the research and development stage to develop a prototype.

# Why in discussion?

Officials of the Election Commission (EC) are exploring the possibility of using blockchain technology for voting in remote areas so that the geographical barriers associated with voting can be removed.

# Key points:

- Various political parties have demanded from the Election Commission that the voting of migrant laborers who are deprived of voting should be ensured.
- Migrant workers cannot go home to exercise their franchise during elections, so they have to go to that city. They should be allowed to vote for their constituency in which they are working.

# Blockchain technology:

- A blockchain is a system in which a database of records is visible on multiple computers, regardless of whether it is updated with any new digital information.
- It offers a unique combination of a system capable of record keeping, enabling real-time transactions, transparency and accounting without unauthorized interference.
- The initial and primary use of blockchain technology was to monitor cryptocurrency (such as bitcoin) transactions. However, over the years, other uses and applications have emerged.
- Blockchain technology is being used by the government of Andhra Pradesh and Telangana in the maintenance of land records.

# **Blockchain technology in voting:**

- Concerns such as election security, voter registration integrity, voter access, and increasing voter turnout have prompted governments to consider the use of blockchain-based voting systems, to increase confidence in the voting system and participation in essential democratic processes.
- Although electronic voting has been used in various forms since the 1970s, it is helpful compared to paper-based systems. The feasibility of blockchain for effective e-voting is currently being explored.
- A one-way electronic system has been used by the Election Commission for voters working in the service sector (consisting of armed forces, central paramilitary forces, and central government officials posted in Indian missions abroad). As in the year 2019 Lok Sabha elections, 'Electronically Transmitted Postal Ballot System-ETPBS' was used.
- Because of the features found in blockchain technology such as decentralized, transparent, immutable, and encrypted systems, this technology can help in reducing electoral tampering and increasing the voting percentage.

# Possible Working:

- Voter identification will be done using a multi-layered IT-enabled system (with the help of biometrics and web cameras) at the polling place in the remote voting process through blockchain technology.
- Once the 'Voter Identification System' is installed, a blockchain-technology-based personalized e-Ballet paper will be generated.
- When the vote is cast, the ballot will be securely encrypted and a blockchain hashtag (#) will be generated. This hashtag notification will be sent to various stakeholders i.e. candidates and political parties.

# Challenges:

- Any new technology system based on blockchain technology is vulnerable to cyber-attacks and other security vulnerabilities.
- These techniques can lead to vote manipulation, paper trail erasure, or electoral chaos.
- Also, voter verification system in which biometric software is used. A facial Recognition Based Verification System can create many types of rumors and confusions regarding identity among voters.
- Blockchain-based voting systems can also raise privacy risks and concerns.

# Way ahead:

- Any innovative technology needs to balance security concerns and technological innovation. Thus, the most efficient technology provider and the system should be used in the blockchain-based voting system.
- The Election Commission should first test the implementation of the blockchain-based voting system on a small scale and then explore the possibility on a large scale.
