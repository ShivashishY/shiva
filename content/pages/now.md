## Exploring

Recently I am doing a sabbatical break, and spend my time to read books, watch some TV-Shows, Deep diving into different programming languages, and Relearning some Computer Science Fundamental topics.

## Programming

Programming a few web apps of my personal projects and [client's](https://shivas.gtsb.io/work-with-me).

## Writing

I have been thinking about writing a book on an idea that I have been most excited about for the last two years. But also writing about SQL fundamental book which can help new-bies to learn complex things in a easy way. I'm currently working on the first draft.

But more about that, later.
