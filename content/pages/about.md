Nice to see you here! You have landed on My Blog website.

![Me](../images/shiva3.png)

Hello! üëãüèΩ I‚Äôm Shivashish Yadav a fresh Post Graduate in MCA & self-taught developer with over 2 years self experience. Now I‚Äôm based in Mumbai, India, working for freelance, jobseeker and learning about programming on Youtube, Stackoverflow, Github and Codepen.io.

I started coding sometime around 2011, which is when I started studying Computer Science in the Punjab Technical University. After getting my BSc, I studied MCA. I've worked with various technologies including Networking and Database in the past, but recently I've taken an interest in web development and web applications and programming. Ever since then, I've considered myself devoted to computer science.
I started this website as a place to document everything projects I've created, tutorials I've written, and anything else I want to show the world. I learn in public and write everything I know.

You can contact me by email at shivashishmca@gmail.com to say hi! I always appreciate meeting new people.
