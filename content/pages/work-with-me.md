I can help you to maximize and take your project to the next level with modern front-end tools, serverless architecture, and CMS Integrations.

> I am currently accepting new contracts. If your project is so awesome that people can't ignore, do [reach me out](https://shiva.gtsb.io/contact).

## Philosophy

My primary principle is **getting things done** but only those “things” that have a purpose and create value for my employer or client.

-   I also believe in **no-blame engineering culture** and have learned from my own mistakes through a postmortem process.
-   I enjoy teaching and mentoring. I believe **knowledge transfer** is important in software engineering.

## Front End

I prefer to use recent and popular tools on new projects which currently means one of the reactive frameworks like Vue.js or React.

I am particularly strong in these technologies and skills:

-   Modern, semantic **HTML**
-   Recent **JavaScript** (ECMAScript 6 and newer)
-   Modern **CSS**. CSS3 with its grid and flexbox helps make advanced designs to be done with a lot less code.
-   Reactive frameworks (**Vue.js** + Vuex, **React** + Redux and others)
-   **User interfaces** from scratch or using component libraries and design systems
-   Usability and accessibility
-   **Data visualization** (interactive SVG grahpics)
-   Development tooling (using **Node.js** and the NPM ecosystem)

## JAMStack

Build fast and secure sites and apps delivered by pre-rendering files and serving them directly from a CDN, removing the requirement to manage or run web servers, databases and worry about traffic spikes.

-   Next.js
-   Gatsby.js
-   Netlify
-   Mailgun
-   FaunaDB
-   Cloudinary

## CMS

A content management system (CMS) is an application that is used to manage web content, allowing multiple contributors to create, edit and publish content.

### The Traditional CMS with Wordpress

Content in a Traditional CMS is typically stored in a database and displayed in a presentation layer based on a set of templates. This monolithic system shares the same backend and frontend language.

### The Headless CMS with Wordpress

A Headless CMS is a back-end only content management system, that makes content accessible via a RESTful or GraphQL API for display on any device. This is decoupled system.

-   **Git**

Git is a modern distributed Version Control System for source code. I use Git everyday and all my projects are tracked with a Git version. I host my projects on private GitHub repositories and track related issues on the GitHub issue tracker.

-   **Postman**

All my projects are API centric and I freeze the API schema before jumping into code. Postman helps us share the API with the team and allows the developers to test them separate from the UI.

## How to Hire me

If the skills I can offer sound like useful additions to your existing team or want to me to help with starting a project from scratch, please [contact me](https://shiva.gtsb.io/contact).

I am happy to work on-site in India, occasionally show up at more distant destinations or work fully remote anywhere else.
